        <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

        <p>Our goal is to provide a service that allows users to encourage others by reaching out using our online social currency system. While we respect the ownership of the content that users share, users are responsible for the content that he or she provides. Because of these principles, we do not actively monitor nor censor user content, except in the limited circumstances as described below.</p>

        <h2>Content Boundaries and Use of Medic Connect</h2>

        <p>In order to continue providing the Medic Connect service, which gives users the ability to communicate and stay connected with others, there are some limitations on the type of content that we will allow to be published. Such limitations comply with legal requirements, which we believe will make Medic Connect a better user experience for all. Any such breach of the Medic Connect Code of Conduct may result in that user being temporarily or permanently suspended. Medic Connect may update or modify such content boundaries from time to time by posting the changes on this site:</p>
